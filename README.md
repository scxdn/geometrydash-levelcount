# geometrydash-levelcount
live gd total level count using colon's gdbrowser api

a *lot* of this uses very old (2-4y) shitty code of mine that i hastely repurposed in time for 100 million. pls dont judge me ;w;

this is the code i used for this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgr0vTJoHDg // https://twitter.com/xdncolonthree/status/1752167035889762758



**setup:**

you need nodeJS :3
place all the files into a single folder, doesn't matter where.
open up terminal, make sure you are in the current directory, and type
```
npm init -y
```
then,
```
npm i express
```
```
npm i cors
```
```
npm i node-fetch@2
```
once that is finished installing, you should be able to type `node index.js` and the script should start. you can test this by going to `http://localhost:6969` in your browser. if it works, open up the html files, they should work!
they're all seperate, and not really good looking from the browser. this is because they were intended to be used within obs studio, and not in the browser. i made these for myself or a specific niche use lol. only releasing this since ive been asked to
